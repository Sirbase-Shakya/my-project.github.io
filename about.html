            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Established in 2010 in the heart of Kathmandu, our restaurant was founded by Chef Rajesh Sharma, a
                passionate Nepali culinary artist dedicated to preserving and celebrating authentic Nepali cuisine. What
                began as a small family kitchen has blossomed into one of Kathmandu's most beloved dining destinations,
                known for its traditional flavors and warm hospitality.</p>
            <p>Chef Rajesh's journey started with his grandmother's recipes and his deep love for Nepali food culture.
                He trained extensively to perfect traditional cooking methods while respecting the culinary heritage of
                Nepal. Today, our restaurant continues to honor these traditions while welcoming both locals and
                visitors to experience the true taste of Nepal.</p>
